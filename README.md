# Toogle
This project was inspired by [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org) but for Typescript

## Running it
After cloning the files you can compile and run the toogle.cpp file

```bash
g++ ./toogle.cpp -o toogle.out
./toogle.out <TYPESCRIPT_FILENAME>
```

I have provided a typescript file called math.ts ( although it is not related to math lol )

# Warning
This project does not work with all types. For example, ...number[] wont work
